DESCRIPTION: Contained here are the .ipynb files to execute the CNN-LSTM model against the traditional CNN model and evaluating it on the AG_NEWS dataset and the IMDB dataset

EXECUTION: Choose the notebook that you want to use for the dataset you want to test, either AG_News or IMDB, and run it. Each lab has install nodes for any library that you might have missing, but execution is just straight-forward running of each consecutive node.
